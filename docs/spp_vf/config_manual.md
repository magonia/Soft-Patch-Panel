# SPP_VF Config Manual

## Forwarder Type

There are three types of forwarder for 1:1, 1:N and N:1.

  * forward: 1:1
  * classifier_mac: 1:N (Destination is determined by MAC address)
  * merge: N:1

### Restrictions

  * Different types of forwarder cannot assing on same core.
  * Only one classifier_mac is allowed (Cannot use two or more).

## Port Type

There are three port types.

  * phy: Physical NIC
  * vhost: Vhost PMD for VMs
  * ring: Ring PMD for spp components

Each of ports is identified as resource ID with port type and resource ID.
For example, resource ID of physical NIC of ID 0 is described as `phy:0`.

## Config Format

Config files is described in JSON format.
Config file consists of `vfs` and defines the spp_vf attribute.

### Attributes in Config

  * vfs
    * name: Name of spp_vf component.
    * num_vhost: Number of vhosts spp_vf use.
    * num_ring: Number of rings spp_vf use.
    * functions: List of forwarders and its attributes (function means a forwarder).
      * core: Core ID forwarder running on.
      * type: Forwarder type (`forward`, `classifier_mac`, or `merger`).
      * rx_port: Resource ID(s) of rx port.
      * tx_port: Resource ID(s) of tx port.

## Sample Config

Here is default config `spp.json` and network diagram of it.
